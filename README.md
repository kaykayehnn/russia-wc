## Documentation

The main theme of this project is the World Cup in Russia. Match data is provided by [Football-Data](https://www.football-data.org).

Frameworks and technologies used on the backend:

- ExpressJS
- MongoDB for storage
- Redis for caching
- Authentication is implemented through JsonWebTokens.

Frameworks and libraries used on the frontend:

- React for view management
- Redux for state management(also react-redux bindings and redux-thunk middleware)
- Webpack
- Babel

## Available functionality

Non authenticated users are only presented with a login/register form and credits, mentioning used assets and their artists.
Once a user logs in they get access to the Dashboard, which shows all of the 32 teams in a grid along with their record of wins, draws and losses. There is a team details page, which shows the team's crest and the matches they've competed in, and a match details page, which shows its outcome and available stats, such as half-time score, full-time score, etc. A user can also favourite their supported teams and view only their stats in a concise manner at their profile page.
Administrators have access to a list of all users and can edit them and delete them.
